I have implemented this project as part of the course ECE627 (Introduction to Cryptography) at Purdue School of Engineering at IUPUI. 
The instructor was PRofessor Brian King.

The application needs Visual Studio 2010 or higher to compile.
Then there is a GUI to enter user name and password (for first time sign up) to sign in.
Then there are few buttons to add passwords or to display the saved passwords.
The passwords are kept in a file withe username[.pswds] encrypted and converted to base64
